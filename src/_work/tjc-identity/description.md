While working as a member of the design team at <a href="http://tjcuk.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="TJC homepage">TJC</a>, I was tasked with the full redesign and refresh of the company brand, stationery and&nbsp;signage.

By drawing from features of the local geographic area as well as iconic landmarks I was able to create a sleek and professional feel whilst paying homage to the roots of the company. The importance of the acronym could not to be understated as it was established that most, if not all clients referred to the company exclusively as "TJC". This lead to the conception of a unique monogram that is both distinct yet easily recognizable to existing clients and local businesses in the&nbsp;region.
