The brief outlined and identified a gap in the market for an audio enthusiast community platform. Up to this point, much of the community were interacting across a disparate set of forums run by the audio manufacturers&nbsp;themselves. 

I developed a conceptual idea to bring everyone together under a single roof. The platform was designed to build upon standard forum conventions while fixing many of the shortcomings present in other implementations. Being funded and moderated by one of the biggest names in LP12 turntable customization added credence and authority to the&nbsp;product.

As the lead designer on this project I worked closley with Cymbiosis to develop a series of desktop, tablet and mobile interface&nbsp;visuals.
