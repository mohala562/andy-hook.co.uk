I have a particular interest in figure drawing, portrait pieces and the relationship between light and form. In these studies I wanted to explore these areas and refine my abilities with a Wacom tablet, challenging myself to draw straight to a digital canvas where I would normally use scanned paper sketches to&nbsp;start.

Technology affords designers and artists many benefits, not least having incredibly accurate colour mixing tools. The ability to quickly re compose a piece is simply amazing when compared to traditional drawing techniques and allows you to be much more experimental when working&nbsp;digitally.
