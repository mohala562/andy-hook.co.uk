Over the last few years I've had the pleasure of working with a huge variety of clients on a range of email focused marketing campaigns. When used correctly, email marketing is a very effective tool and I strive to produce designs that not only achieve business objectives and marketing goals but are also visually compelling and push the limits of (limited) email&nbsp;technology. 

From brief through to design conception, development, data handling, campaign launch and ROI reporting, I handle every aspect of the process to the highest&nbsp;standard.
