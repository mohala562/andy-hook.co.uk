During my time at <a href="http://tjcuk.co.uk/" target="_blank" title="TJC homepage">TJC</a> we had the pleasure of working with a huge variety of clients on a range of email focused marketing campaigns. When used correctly, email marketing is a very effective tool and we would always strive to produce designs that would not only achieve business objectives and marketing goals but were also visually compelling and really pushed the limits of (limited) email&nbsp;technology.

From brief through to design conception, development, data handling, campaign launch and ROI reporting, we handled every aspect of the process to the highest&nbsp;standard.
